## About Me

I am a .NET developer from Gothenburg who never stops learning. Prior to Corona I worked as a Design Engineer in the automotive industry of Gothenburg but when I discovered my talent and passion for writing code I changed my career and never looked back.

I enjoy writing clean, specific and well abstracted code that is easy to maintain and to understand. I do small projects, read books and practice coding for fun an

I enjoy coding generally and for example I do pick up [books](/school-of-thought) about OOD or design and I do spend the extra time to understand something thoroughly. I get ideas and epiphanies about problems around the clock and I will keep it up.

I have a strong mental game from my years in competitive sailing and have a never ending energy and stamina when it comes to problem solving. In a team I work autonomously, take initiatives and I am not afraid to ask questions and learn from the people around me.
