## What programming roles do you think is for you?

### Backend Developer

With over [2000 editor hours](/stats) in C# last two years and lots of theoretical knowledge in Object Oriented Design, Code Architecture and System Development I am a great candidate for any team as a backend developer where my primary languages are: C# then Python and Node.js.

### Full Stack Cloud Developer

My education as .NET Developer at the vocational school of [Teknik HÃ¶gskolan](https://teknikhogskolan.se/utbildningar/net-utvecklare/) former name was actually Full Stack Developer, we learn everything from T-SQL, C#, JavaScript to Azure CLI, docker and Cosmos DB, checkout more tech [here](/tech). I also [blogged](https://robinaxelsson.github.io/) about cloud development during my .NET Education course on the same subject.

### React Developer

I enjoy this powerful UI framework and I have the foundations to build upon to become a good developer in your team.

### CAD/PLM Developer

I have a wide understanding of CAD and PLM systems from my time as a Design Engineer, my first programs/scripts where actually for Catia V5.

## What is your background?

I am a .NET developer from Gothenburg who never stops learning. Prior to Corona I worked as a Design Engineer in the automotive industry of Gothenburg but when I discovered my talent and passion for writing code I changed my career and never looked back.

---

## What do you like about programming?

I enjoy writing clean, specific and well abstracted code that is easy to maintain and to understand. I always have some projects, I read books about OOD and practice coding for the fun of it. I get ideas and epiphanies about problems around the clock (which is not always a good thing) and I do spend the extra time to understand something thoroughly.

## What I want to do in the future?

I want to develop industry level libraries and frameworks

---

## What are your strengths?

I have a strong mental game from my years in competitive sailing and have a never ending energy and stamina when it comes to problem solving. In a team I work autonomously, take initiatives and I am not afraid to ask questions and learn from the people around me.

## What are your weaknesses?

I can give you one example I have hard time keeping every day stuff in my head, like dates and times, so I always bring an analog notebook or block of some kind around.
