            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>I am a .NET developer from Gothenburg who never stops learning. Prior to Corona I worked as a Design
                    Engineer in the automotive industry of Gothenburg but when I discovered my talent and passion for
                    writing code I changed my career and never looked back.</p>
                <p>I love writing clean, specific and well abstracted code that is easy to maintain and to understand. I
                    always have some projects, I read books about OOD and practice coding for the fun of it. I get ideas
                    and epiphanies about problems around the clock (which is not always a good thing) and I do spend the
                    extra time to understand something thoroughly.</p>
                <p>I have a strong mental game from my years in competitive sailing and have a neverending energy and
                    stamina when it comes to problem solving. In a team, I work autonomously, take initiatives and I am
                    not afraid to ask questions and learn from the people around me.</p>

                <p><strong>Exchange Rates Fetcher SOAP to REST - Bokio</strong>
                    <br>Bokio is a bookkeeping web app targeting big and small companies on the Swedish market.
                    Bokio has some banking features that rely on having up-to-date exchange rates from the Swedish currency.
                    The problem was that our current implimentation SOAP was soon end of life and will be replaced by a REST API (that was not mapped one to one).
                    I wrote a custom http client integration that fetched exchange rate data on a given time every day to sync it to a SQL database.
                    I also implemented the endpoints for the frontend and a  fallback to directly call the Web API directly if the server sync was down.

                    <br>Cendot is a monolithic desktop app that is distributed on Citrix servers to the Iver Employees.
                    Cendots architecture is of MVVM design and is all written in C#. The core domain logic is also used
                    in company owned apps as dll:s or nugets in web apps, worker services and REST API:s. As a diverse
                    IT-Service company with its own self made business eco-system (Cendot) and its own development
                    appartment, Iver process owners have an intimate connection with our developer team. Together we
                    design and discuss new features that automate processes, simplifys time reporting, pricing and
                    invoicing. We also enable new pricing models and business concepts.

                    designed a core app that integrates with the SystemWeaver nuget API and collects the relevant data
