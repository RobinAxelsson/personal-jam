            <div class="section-content">
                <p>I am a .NET developer from Gothenburg who never stops learning. Before the covid pandemic I worked as a Design
                    Engineer in the Gothenburg's automotive industry but when I discovered my talent and passion for
                    writing code I changed my career to fully commit to Software Engineering.</p>
                <p>I am a meticulous coder who values well-abstracted, simple code that is easy to test, maintain, and understand.
                    I always have personal learning projects on the go and enjoy reading programming books when relevant.
                    I am deeply curious and love diving into new fields to gain a thorough understanding. I often have ideas and
                    epiphanies about problems at all hours (which isn’t always ideal), and I am committed to spending extra
                    time to grasp concepts completely.</p>
                <p>I have developed a strong mental game through my years in competitive sailing, along with endless energy and stamina
                    for problem-solving. In a team setting, I work autonomously, take initiative, and am not afraid to ask questions
                    or learn from those around me.</p>

                    <h3>Exchange Rates Fetcher SOAP to REST - Bokio</h3>
                    <p>Bokio is a bookkeeping web app targeting big and small companies on the Swedish market.
                        Bokio has some banking features that rely on having up-to-date exchange rates from the Swedish
                        currency.
                        The problem was that our current implimentation SOAP was soon end of life and will be replaced
                        by a
                        REST API (that was not mapped one to one).
                        I wrote a custom http client integration that fetched exchange rate data on a given time every
                        day
                        to sync it to a SQL database.
                        I also implemented the endpoints for the frontend and a fallback to directly call the Web API
                        directly if the server sync was down.
