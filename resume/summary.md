## About

I am a .NET developer from Gothenburg who never stops learning. Prior to Corona I worked as a Design Engineer in the automotive industry of Gothenburg but when I discovered my talent and passion for writing code I changed my career and never looked back.

My current area of learning is writing clean, well abstracted object oriented code. I am also a coder on my free time and for example enjoy picking up a book about OOD or spend some extra time on my current projects. It happens I code in my sleep and wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas and solutions I just have to try out.

I have a strong mental game from my years in competitive sailing and have a never ending energy and stamina when it comes to problem solving. In a team I work autonomously, take initiatives and I am not afraid to ask questions and learn from the people around me.
